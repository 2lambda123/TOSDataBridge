TOSDataBridge v0.1


TOSDataBridge (TOSDB) is an open-source collection of resources for 'scraping' real-time
streaming data off of TDAmeritrade's ThinkOrSwim(TOS) platform, providing C, C++, and 
Python interfaces. It was initially created as an in-house tool to provide free, extensible, 
real-time financial data for testing other code.  It was not written as production quality 
and should not be expected to perform as such - it works but is not stable. Users of the 
TOS platform - with at least a desire to learn some programming/scripting basics - can use 
this tool to populate databases of historical financial data; perform specialized, low-level, 
and effecient analysis on large data-sets in real-time; test and debug other financial apps; 
or even build extensions on top of it.
