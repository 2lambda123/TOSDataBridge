{"name":"TOSDataBridge v0.2","tagline":"Free, Real-Time Streaming Market Data from your TOS Platform - API [C,C++,Python]","body":"## TOSDataBridge v0.2 \r\n- - -\r\nTOSDataBridge (TOSDB) is an open-source collection of resources for 'scraping' real-time streaming data off of TDAmeritrade's ThinkOrSwim(TOS) platform, providing C, C++, and Python interfaces. Users of the TOS platform - with some basic programming/scripting knowledge - can use these tools to populate their own databases with market data; analyze large data-sets in real-time; test and debug other financial apps; or even build extensions on top of it.\r\n\r\nTOSDB uses TOS's antiquated, yet still useful, DDE feature, directly through the Windows API. The C / C++ interfaces are implemented as a shared library(DLL) that communicates with a back-end Windows Service. The Python interface wraps this library in a more object-oriented, user-friendly format, providing an interactive environment for easy access to the low(er)-level calls.\r\n\r\nObviously the core implementation is not portable, but the python interface does provides a thin virtualization layer over TCP. A user running Windows in a Virtual Machine, for instance, can expose the exact same python interface to a different host system running python3. \r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n- - -\r\n- Windows for the core implementation(tested on Windows 7 SP1, Vista SP2,and Server 2008 R2.) The python interface is available to any system running python3(also tested on Debian/Linux-3.2.)\r\n- TDAmeritrade's ThinkOrSwim(TOS) platform that exposes DDE functionality (the Window's verion)\r\n- VC++ 2012 Redistributable (included)\r\n- Python3 (optional, for the python wrapper)\r\n- Some basic Windows knowledge; some basic C, C++, or Python programming knowledge\r\n\r\n### Quick Setup\r\n- - -\r\n- tosdb-setup.bat will attempt to install the necessary modules/dependencies for you but you should refer to **Installation Details** below for a more detailed explanation\r\n- Be sure to know what build you need(x86 vs x64); it should match your system, all the modules you'll need, and your version of Python(if you plan on using the python wrapper)\r\n\r\n    ##### Core C/C++ Libraries\r\n    ```\r\n    (Admin) C:\\[...TOSDataBridge]\\tosdb-setup.bat   [x86|x64]   [admin]   [session]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    - [x86|x64] : the version to build (required)\r\n    - [admin] : does your TOS platform require elevation? (optional) \r\n    - [session] : override the service's attempt to determine the session id when exiting from session-0 isolation. MOST USERS SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THIS unless they plan to run in a non-standard environment (e.g an EC2 instance). The tos-databridge-engine.exe[] binary needs to run in the same session as the ThinkOrSwim platform. (optional)\r\n\r\n    ##### Python Wrapper (optional)\r\n    ```\r\n    C:\\[...TOSDataBridge]\\python\\python setup.py install\r\n    ```\r\n    - Core C/C++ libs (above) must be installed first to use the (non-virtual) interface\r\n    - C++ python extensions have been converted to pure python to avoid portability/build issues. (tosdb/_tosdb.py is now generated automatically by setup.py)\r\n\r\n### Quick Start\r\n- - -\r\n1. You may need to white-list some of these files (specifically tos-databridge-engine-\\[x86|x64].exe) in your Anti-Virus software before proceeding.\r\n2. Start the service:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    (Admin) C:\\> SC start TOSDataBridge\r\n    ```\r\n3. Log on to your TOS platform\r\n\r\n##### For C/C++:\r\n- Include tos_databridge.h header in your code (if C++ make sure containers.hpp and generic.hpp can be found by the compiler)\r\n- Use the library calls detailed in the **C/C++ Interface...** sections below\r\n- Link with *tos-databridge-0.2-[x86|x64].dll*\r\n- Build\r\n- Run\r\n\r\n##### For Python:\r\n- Open a python shell/interpreter or create a script\r\n- import tosdb\r\n- tosdb.init(...)\r\n\r\n\r\n### License & Terms\r\n- - -\r\n*TOSDB is released under the GNU General Public License(GPL); a copy (LICENSE.txt) should be included.
